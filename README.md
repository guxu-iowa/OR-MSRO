# OR-MSRO
The repository hosts the codes developed to implement decision rules that are used to solve multi-stage robust optimization problems. The decision rules are developed in the paper "Improved Decision Rule Approximations for Multi-Stage Robust Optimization via Copositive Programming". 

All optimization problems are solved using MOSEK 8.1.0.56 via the YALMIP interface on a 16-core 3.4 GHz Linux PC with 32 GB RAM. Computation times are reported in the paper.
